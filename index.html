                <p><img class="profile" src="./assets/images/profile_pic.jpeg" />My name is Matthew Starr and welcome to
                    my page. I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and lived there until I was 19 then moved to
                    Charlotte, North
                    Carolina back in 2004.Some of my interests are playing guitar, video games and playing with
                    electronics.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am a software engineer currently attending a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte.
                    This is an exciting career change with plenty of challenge. This is a career that you never stop
                    learning. That very thing keeps me on my toes. I like that there are plenty of avenues to take with
                    this career change. I have been learning at a very fast pace in the program. When I look back to my
                    first projects I am amazed at what I can do now. Every day I am faced with a new problem that I need
                    to come up with a solution for. Sometimes it is frustrating but if I stay at it I figure it out and
                    that outweighs the struggle.
